    checking for the column name and since * isn't really a column name, therefore,
    using something like the `existing` iteration (get_used_columns).
    I have a couple of Ideas to solve this ðŸ¤”

1 (resolved). Do we want to even allow * queries since, how will each column's sensitivity going to come
    into play in that case?


2. Impelemnt a middleware for query restrictions
2 (resolved) We technically don't need anything extraordinary for this since we can just, set the sensitivity to inf


3. Budget reduction

4. Tests!
